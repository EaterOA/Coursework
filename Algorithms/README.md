Algorithms
==========

Implementations coupled with contrived use cases of any interesting or useless
algorithm.

(Really just a catch-all for random code snippets I wrote for one reason or
another)

- a\_star.cpp: Implementation and demonstration of the A\* algorithm on 2D grid
- BigNum.hpp: Include to use a highly-inefficient C++ big integer class.
- bternary.cpp: Converts an int into a list of balanced ternary digits. Why the hell would you want to do that? Good question!
- dijkstra.cpp: Implementations (of different time complexities) and sample application of Dijkstra's algorithm
- lockpatterns.cpp: Counts how many lock patterns there are in a traditional smart phone pattern lock screen.
- sieve.cpp: An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. Optimized using tricks from [Project Euler](https://github.com/EaterOA/Euler).
- sudoku.cpp: Solves any sudoku board given an initial configuration.
- tictactoe.cpp: Interactive Tic Tac Toe program against a perfect AI.
- mmap_example.cpp: Example usage of *drumroll* mmap. Specifically, it showcases file-based mmap as well as anonymous shared mmap for multiprocessing.
- lucas.py: Implements Lucas' Theorem in Python for computing remainders of large combinations.
