Algorithms
==========

Implementations coupled with contrived use cases of any interesting and useless
algorithms.

- BigNum.hpp: Include to use a highly-inefficient C++ big integer class.
- bternary.cpp: Converts an int into a list of balanced ternary digits. Why the hell would you want to do that? Good question!
- lockpatterncounter.cpp: Counts how many lock patterns there are in a traditional smart phone pattern lock screen. No use whatsoever.
- sieve.cpp: An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers.
- sudoku.cpp: Solves any given sudoku board.
- tictactoe.cpp: Interactive Tic Tac Toe program against a perfect AI.
