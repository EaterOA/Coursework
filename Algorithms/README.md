Algorithms
==========

Implementations coupled with contrived use cases of any interesting and useless
algorithms.

(Really just a catch-all for random code snippets I wrote for one reason or
another)

- BigNum.hpp: Include to use a highly-inefficient C++ big integer class.
- bternary.cpp: Converts an int into a list of balanced ternary digits. Why the hell would you want to do that? Good question!
- dijkstra.cpp: Implementation and sample application of Dijkstra's algorithm
- lockpatterns.cpp: Counts how many lock patterns there are in a traditional smart phone pattern lock screen.
- sieve.cpp: An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers. Optimized using tricks from [Project Euler](https://github.com/EaterOA/Euler).
- sudoku.cpp: Solves any sudoku board given an initial configuration.
- tictactoe.cpp: Interactive Tic Tac Toe program against a perfect AI.
