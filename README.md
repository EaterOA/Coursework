What
==========

Miscellaneous, *non-graded* stuff that I wrote for some of the classes I've been in. Some of these are created for fun (like implementations of an algorithm learned in class) or as tools to help myself with the course material.

Caution: Typically these are written in haste without any regard to maintainability/quality.
