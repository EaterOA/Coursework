Utilities
==========

A (miserable) collection of utility scripts for use in extraordinary situations (i.e. almost never).

- dns.sh: A script to test DNS. Comes with pretty colors.
- tidyfy.sh: A script that cleans up source files by removing those pesky carriage returns, trailing spaces, and non-newline-eofs
