Utilities
==========

A (miserable) collection of utility scripts for use in extraordinary situations (i.e. almost never).

- dns.sh: A script to test DNS resolution. Useful when you suddenly feel like mucking with your bind server and need to monitor your domain and/or connectivity to the Internet but don't want to read host's ugly output and prefer to sacrifice useful information for this script's pretty colors.
- tidyfy.sh: A script that cleans up source files by removing those pesky carriage returns, trailing spaces, non-newline-eofs, and tabs.
- modify_by_creation.sh: A script that touches regular files in an NTFS mounted directory in the order of creation times. Sometimes useful for dual-booting noobs like me.
