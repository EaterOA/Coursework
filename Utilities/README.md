Utilities
==========

A (miserable) collection of utility algorithms or data structures for use in extraordinary situations (i.e. almost never).

- BigNum.hpp: Include to use a highly-inefficient C++ big integer
- bternary.cpp: Converts an int into a list of balanced ternary digits. Why? Good question
- sieve.cpp: An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers
- lockpatterncounter.cpp: Counts how many possible lock patterns there are in a traditional smart phone lock screen. No use whatsoever.
